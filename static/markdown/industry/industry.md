### Description 

During my Intership at Giro I was asked to develop an internal application in order to lock and manipulate databases. the actua application were relying on ancient, slow and not versatile technologies. Using bash, powershell, c++ and some of the microsofort power apps I manage to deliver my mandate on time. I reecived a lot of positive feedback for that project because its application has been extended to the whole devellopement team since then.
