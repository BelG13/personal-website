## My Work

During my Bachelor's degree, I developed a strong theoretical foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science. I completed several fascinating courses, including [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Introduction to Machine Learning</span>](#), [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Physics Modeling</span>](#), [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Theoretical Computer Science</span>](#), and [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Quantum Computing</span>](#). In my Master's program, I deepened my expertise in AI through courses such as [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Probabilistic Graphical Models</span>](#), [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Natural Language Processing</span>](#), and [<span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);">Representation Learning</span>](#). I thoroughly enjoyed these classes, and I am particularly interested in models that handle unstructured data, such as images or text.

I also had the opportunity to complete several internships during my studies. I worked as a [<span style="color: orange;">Software Engineer at Giro</span>](#) and as a [<span style="color: orange;">Data Scientist at Intact</span>](#).
