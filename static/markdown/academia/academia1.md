To give a clearer picture of my work during my master's, here’s a brief overview of my course projects:

### <span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);"> Probabilistic Graphical Models </span>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="../../../media/imgs/academia/tist-2021-02-0106-f07.jpg" /></div>

**Description:**  
This course introduces the statistical modeling of multidimensional data using probabilistic graphical models, focusing on learning and inference algorithms.

**Final Project:**  
We enhanced Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by using **Hierarchical Hidden Markov Chains (HHMM)**, a multi-layer architecture that captures more complex patterns. We constructed a recursive structure allowing high parallelization, resulting in significantly better performance, as shown in the graph below.

**Description:**  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. This course covers both fundamental and cutting-edge NLP techniques, emphasizing Deep Learning.

**Final Project:**  
We developed a **multi-agent debate framework** where multiple large language models (LLMs) debate to answer questions. This approach reduces hallucinations by leveraging the consensus among different models and debate rounds.

### <span style="color: rgb(63, 50, 209);"> Representation Learning </span>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center; height:40%; width:100%"><img src="../../../media/imgs/academia/gan-illustration.jpg" style="height:40%; width:40%"/></div>

**Description:**  
This course delves into deep learning, covering neural networks, convolutional networks, LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and modern generative models like **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**.
